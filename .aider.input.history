+if the role is "patient" I'd like to prepare the following suggested questions a user can click on to update the message as alternative options to enter the text input for my_question. Here are the sample questions I also want to offer: I have a tongue tremor – is that common with PD? What is best early treatment for PD; I just got diagnosed I had a DAT scan for tremor and its normal, but doctor thought it was PD, what is the cause of my tremor? It was a pretty good answer! I heard about deep brain stimulation and want to know if I should get that treatment for Parkinson’s disease I want to generate some patient instructions for a patient with Parkinson’s disease who is going to be admitted to the hospital for an elective surgery. Provide some guidance on precautions to ensure minimize risk in patients with PD who are hospitalized.
